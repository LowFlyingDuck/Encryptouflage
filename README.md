 This is a website, that can encrypt and decrypt messsages. (API Integration)

## About
 On this page, you can encrypt and decrypt any text message. This might be useful for encrypting Emails or Files in order to prevent third parties from monitoring the matter.
 
 This encryption works with one of the following algorithms:
 - AES-256-CFB
 - AES-256-CFB1
 - AES-256-CFB8
 - AES-256-CTR
 - AES-256-GCM
 - AES-256-CCM
 
 and digests the output in a chosen encoding. By default, the encrypted message is output in words format, camouflaging the message to automated email filters.
